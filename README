 earliest=0 index=* 
 | head 1 
 | eval cchef="abcd1234" 
 | eval cchef_b64=cchef 
 | base64 field=cchef_b64 action=encode

In the result set, locate the field named cchef and observe the associated workflow actions.

Substitute these values for the cchef field inb the search above to test different CyberChef recipes:
 - CyberChef-From_Base64 -> "SGV5IHRoZXJlLCBTcGx1bmsgdXNlciE="
 - CyberChef-From_Charcode -> "42 65 63 61 73 75 65 20 6e 69 6e 6a 61 73 20 61 72 65 20 74 6f 6f 20 62 75 73 79 2e 2e 2e"
 - CyberChef-From_Hex -> "54 61 6b 65 20 74 68 65 20 53 48 20 6f 75 74 20 6f 66 20 49 54"
 - CyberChef-From_Hexdump -> "43 6f 6f 6c 20 73 74 6f 72 79 2c 20 62 72 6f"
 
 
Use more/different CyberChef Recipes
------------------------------------
The provided workflow actions only represent a few of the many CyberChef Recipes. To create a workflow action to a new/different recipe, update the URL in the workflow action definition. Use CyberChef itself to to deternibne the changes. For example, the CyberChef recipe to convert to binary is "To_Binary('Space')".  


Apply Workflow Actions to Different Fields
------------------------------------------
To apply these workflow actions to a different field, do the following:

To apply the CyberChef workflow actions to a field called content_body
 -Create a base64 version of the field: base64 field=contentbody_b64 action=encode
 -Modify the workflow action definition to apply to content_body
 -Modify the workflow action defineiton to pass $content_body_b54$ to Cyberchef


To Use Your Own CyberChef Instance
----------------------------------
These definitions use the demo CyberChef instance provided by the creators of CyberChef. To use your own instance, simply modify the URL in the workflow definition(s).
